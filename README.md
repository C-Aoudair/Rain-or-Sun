# Rain-or-Sun: Project Plan

### üîñ Project Title & Description
**Rain-or-Sun** is a modern, intuitive weather application designed to provide users with real-time and forecasted weather information. It will offer a clean interface for checking current conditions, hourly forecasts, and a 7-day outlook. The app is for anyone who needs quick, reliable weather data, from daily commuters to travel planners. It matters because it simplifies complex weather information, making it accessible and easy to understand for everyone.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
The app will be built using a **Next.js** frontend for a fast, server-rendered user experience. **TypeScript** will be used for type safety and better code maintainability. For styling, we'll use **Tailwind CSS** to build a responsive and mobile-first design system efficiently. The weather data will be sourced from the **OpenWeatherMap API**, known for its accuracy and comprehensive data points. **Jest** and **React Testing Library** will be used for testing the frontend components and logic.

### üß† AI Integration Strategy
We'll leverage AI throughout the development lifecycle to enhance efficiency and quality.

#### **Code Generation**
* **Scaffolding:** An IDE agent, such as **GitHub Copilot**, will be used to scaffold new React components and API service files based on natural language prompts. For example, prompting "create a React component for a weather forecast card that displays temperature and a weather icon" will generate the basic structure.
* **Boilerplate Reduction:** The AI will assist in generating repetitive code, such as API request handlers, state management hooks, and component props, reducing manual effort and potential for errors.

#### **Testing**
* **Unit Tests:** AI tools will be prompted to generate unit tests for specific functions or components. We'll feed the AI the function code and a prompt like "write unit tests for this API utility function, covering success and error cases," to quickly get a set of tests to refine.
* **Integration Tests:** The AI will help in drafting integration tests for user flows, such as testing the process of searching for a city and displaying its weather data. We'll provide a high-level description of the flow to generate test scripts.

#### **Documentation**
* **Docstrings and Comments:** AI will be used to generate comprehensive **JSDoc** comments for functions and components, explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. This ensures a consistent and well-documented codebase. For example, after writing a function, a quick prompt will generate its docstring.
* **README Maintenance:** The AI will help in keeping the `README.md` up-to-date by generating sections for new features, installation instructions, or dependency changes, ensuring documentation stays current with the codebase.

#### **Context-Aware Techniques**
* **API Specs:** We'll feed the **OpenWeatherMap API** documentation directly into the AI to ensure generated code for API calls is accurate and correctly handles request parameters and response structures. This reduces the need to manually cross-reference the documentation.
* **File Tree & Diff Context:** For complex tasks, the AI will be given context on the project's file structure and recent code changes (diffs). This allows the AI to provide more relevant suggestions and fixes, such as refactoring a component and its related styles simultaneously. For example, a prompt like "refactor `WeatherDisplay.tsx` based on these changes" will yield more precise results when the AI understands the broader file context.
